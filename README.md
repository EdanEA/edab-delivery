Edab Delivery
======
## What be this, fam-cycles?
##### Do you remember Discord bots that were real popular, maybe a year or two back, that were supposed to be like delivery systems? Well, this is pretty much like one of those, though it's more supposed to be like a Postmates-esque system, where one place makes the makes the product, and we just deliver it. Do note though, the feature for anyone to add their own shop/restaurant isn't available just yet.


## What we're working on.</h1>
##### Currently we're designing a bit of an economic system, there will be a currency, the ability for users to get jobs and even design their own businesses.
##### All of this is planned to come out in the coming month or two.


## How do you use this?
##### 'Tis quite simple, all you have to do is type "]>order *what you want to order*." Then it will be delivered to you soon.
